I started out this project by going through Laracast tutorials, and found that I caught on to the framework pretty quickly. Many of the patterns aren't substantially different from what I've used in other frameworks, so I decided not to commit significant time to learning more.

I may come back to this project in the future, but I since switched to Effective Java, and am now getting caught up in Salesforce.
